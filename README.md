# Compare Open Access coverage of Wikipedia-cited research across Scotland’s universities</center>


### Overview

This project explores open-access (OA) coverage of Wikipedia-cited research across Scotland’s universities by comparing two different methodologies. The analysis utilises Excel, Python, and Tableau for data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualisation.

### Aims
The main objectives of this project are:

- To assess the extent of OA coverage among Wikipedia-cited research.
- To compare different methodologies for evaluating OA availability.
- To analyse trends and differences across universities in Scotland.

### Findings

<p>Performance compared to the whole 18 universities 
Grouping 1 of the 18 universities investigated includes seven modern universities and three 
specialist institutes. Although Grouping 1 has more universities than Grouping 2, these 
modern universities, like the Specialist institutions focussing on particular fields, have had 
fewer chances to generate a considerable amount of scholarly work. This is reflected in 
their citation counts, which are just 4.6% of all citations, with less than 0.5% attributable to 
specialist universities—significantly lower than the contributions of a single ancient 
university.</p>

<b>Comparison of Two Methodologies </b> :
Compared to previous methodologies, WikiOpenCite simplifies the data retrieval process 
and present data visualization, thereby significantly enhancing both efficiency and user 
experience. While there are areas that could benefit from further refinement, the tool 
represents a considerable advancement at this stage of development.

### Features
- <b>Data Collection </b>: Extracted Wikipedia-cited research metadata.

- <b>Data Processing </b>: Cleaned and structured data using Python.

- <b>Analysis & Visualisation </b>: Explored trends using Tableau and statistical methods.

- <b>Methodology Comparison </b>: Evaluated two approaches to OA measurement.

### Practice
- Built on methodologies used in previous studies, including White Rose research and WikiOpenCite data.
- The study’s findings contribute to discussions on open-access impact and research visibility.


### Extensition
- utilises the data practing Data Scrapping
- utilises the data practing Data Visualisation by python
